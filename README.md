Plex It!
======

Add Online Videos to Plex Queue using a Chrome Extension!

Instead of using a bookmarklet to send online videos to your Plex queue, this is a Chrome extension (so you don't have to always keep that annoying Bookmarks Bar sticking out).
This is NOT officially supported by the Plex Project (yet).
