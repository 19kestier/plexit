Plex It!
======

Add Online Videos to Plex Queue using a Chrome Extension!

Instead of using a bookmarklet to send online videos to your Plex queue, this is a Chrome extension (so you don't have to always keep that annoying Bookmarks Bar sticking out).
This is NOT officially supported by the Plex Project (yet).

To Install
======

Download a compressed file of the extension and decompress it.
Then open Chromium/Chrome and in the Menu choose More Tools and then Extensions. Then hit Load Unpacked Extension and enter the folder you decompressed the files into. The extension will then install.
